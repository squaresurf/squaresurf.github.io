Hello world! The most basic thing done by many a fledgling programmer. It's probably also the most overused topic to
write about as your first blog topic as a programmer. That being said, I couldn't think of a better way to start a new
blog.

<!--more-->

This is my second go at writing to a blog so we'll have to see how well I do this time around. Overall, I will be
focusing my topics on my daily life as a software engineer at [Very](https://www.verypossible.com/), which will most
likely touch DevOps, Front End Engineering, Functional Programming, and Data Science among many other topics. My goal
will be to write a short blog post every ~~day Monday through Friday~~ week. So as you can imagine, the quality of these
posts may be a bit low and the volume high. The hope is that as I force myself to write every ~~weekday~~ day, that I
will get better at this process, and hopefully start to produce content that someone other than myself would find
interesting to read.

Now that I have the basic premise of this blog written out in this post and compiling with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/); I
am going to say sayonara and see if I can't get this live on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

##### Update: 2018.5.18

If you take a look at the list of posts and their dates you can see quickly that I have not been able to post daily nor
weekly. I've updated my goal to blog one post a week at minimum. We'll see if I can hit that goal.
