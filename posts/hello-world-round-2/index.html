write about as your first blog topic as a programmer. That being said, I couldn&rsquo;t think of a better way to start a new
blog.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This is my second go at writing to a blog so we&rsquo;ll have to see how well I do this time around. Overall, I will be
focusing my topics on my daily life as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.verypossible.com/">Very</a>, which will most
likely touch DevOps, Front End Engineering, Functional Programming, and Data Science among many other topics. My goal
will be to write a short blog post every <del>day Monday through Friday</del> week. So as you can imagine, the quality of these
posts may be a bit low and the volume high. The hope is that as I force myself to write every <del>weekday</del> day, that I
will get better at this process, and hopefully start to produce content that someone other than myself would find
interesting to read.</p>

<p>Now that I have the basic premise of this blog written out in this post and compiling with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>; I
am going to say sayonara and see if I can&rsquo;t get this live on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>

<h5 id="update-2018-5-18">Update: 2018.5.18</h5>

<p>If you take a look at the list of posts and their dates you can see quickly that I have not been able to post daily nor
weekly. I&rsquo;ve updated my goal to blog one post a week at minimum. We&rsquo;ll see if I can hit that goal.</p></div>
